# NBody Simulation
Your goal for this project is to write a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.

Ultimately, you will be creating a program NBody.java that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.

The final presention should include graphic comic and sound.
